# Phase Progress

## Last Updated: 2026-05-14 (Phase 1 scaffold complete)

### Hackathon Tracker
- Days to submission (6/21): **38 of 38**
- Days to demo day (7/20–21): **67 of 67**
- Days to winners (8/27): **105 of 105**

### Current Phase
**Phase 1: Scaffold — DONE.** Next: **Phase 2: Sui Integration** (5/20 – 5/29, ~10 days).

See `docs/spec.md` §6 for full 5-phase plan.

### Completed This Session

**Pre-Phase 1 (prior sessions)**:
- Pre-work research: Walrus + Seal deep dive, Sui Overflow 2026 handbook verification, SDK landscape (2026-05-08 release train), Tripo competitive analysis, industry pain points
- Architecture: Composable Creator Economy / Programmable IP Layer (D-001), 3-tier `Model3D + Access + Derivative` (D-002), policy modes (D-003), royalty cap (D-004), snapshot immutability (D-005)
- Tech stack locks: GLB only (D-006), drop react-babylonjs (D-007), @mysten/* pinned (D-008), Walrus upload relay (D-010)
- Strategy: testnet submission, mainnet by 8/27 (D-009)
- Office-hours session (D-011): agentic framing pivot — LLM router orchestrates procedural + Tripo generators; lineage on Walrus
- Office-hours session (D-012): TS unified across browser + server; drop Go; `@gltf-transform/core` + Hono + Node 22 LTS
- Office-hours session (D-013): v1 scope refocus — cut L2 Derivative, promote Kiosk to v1 must-have, framing narrows to 5 Sui+Walrus exclusive selling points

**Phase 1 (this session)**:
- Phase 1 plan `docs/plans/2026-05-14-001-feat-phase-1-scaffold-plan.md` (Lightweight depth, 5 units, ~5 days estimate)
- Local env: Node 22.22.3 installed via nvm, locked via `.nvmrc`; pnpm 8.14.1 (Homebrew) used for workspace
- **U1 — Monorepo skeleton**: root `package.json` + `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + `tsconfig.base.json` + `.editorconfig` + 6 top-level dirs. `pnpm install` clean
- **U2 — `shared/`**: `@overflow2026/shared` workspace with `GenerateParams` (discriminated union), `LineageRecord`, `Generator`, `Router`, `ShapeCatalog`. Builds clean
- **U3 — `backend/`**: Hono on `:3001`, 4 procedural generators (box / chest / cylinder / sphere) via `@gltf-transform/core`, `HardcodedRouter` stub behind `Router` interface, zod-validated `POST /api/generate` + `GET /api/preview/:id` + `GET /api/shapes`. **26/26 unit + route tests green**. Live e2e verified: GLB magic `glTF`, 864 B for a 1×1×1 box
- **U4 — `frontend/`**: Vite + React 19 + imperative Babylon wrapper (per D-007 — no `react-babylonjs`), shape picker with dynamic sliders, `Generate` button, Vite proxy `/api` → backend. **6/6 component tests green** (Babylon mocked for jsdom). Live proxy round-trip verified via curl
- **U5 — E2E + docs**: root `pnpm dev` brings both servers up in parallel; README updated with `Run locally (Phase 1)` section + Stack corrections (Go → Node, missed in earlier README pass); this phase-progress update; Phase 1 dev loop confirmed working
- **Post-implementation review** (`/review` skill): scope clean, 7 findings. Applied 2 [P2] fixes: schema ranges aligned to catalog ranges (`backend/src/lib/schema.ts`) + 2 boundary tests added (`width: -1` → 400, `width: 99` → 400)
- **Real-browser smoke** (D-007 / Plan Risk row 3 mitigation): opened `:5173` in browser, exercised all 4 shapes. **Found: cylinder appeared hollow.** Root cause: top + bottom cap fan winding was CW (faces pointing inward), back-face culled → user saw through the caps. Fix in `backend/src/generators/cylinder.ts:54-64` (swap last two indices on each cap fan) + 2 regression tests (`top cap triangles face +Y`, `bottom cap triangles face -Y`). Tests now catch any future cap-winding regression on cylinder. Other 3 shapes verified visually correct.

### In Progress
- Nothing — Phase 1 closed.

### Next Concrete Step
**Start Phase 2: Sui Integration** (5/20 – 5/29, ~10 days).

Sequencing per `docs/spec.md` §6 Phase 2:
1. **Move contract** — `model3d::model3d` package in `contracts/`. Reference `SharedBlob` pattern from `@mysten/walrus`. Local `sui move test` for mint/extend/burn. Deploy to testnet, record `MODEL3D_PACKAGE_ID`
2. **Walrus** — wire `@mysten/walrus@1.1.7` + `@mysten/walrus-wasm@0.2.2` in frontend, Vite WASM config, upload relay endpoint in backend, `writeFilesFlow` upload from browser
3. **Auth** — dApp Kit 1.0 + Enoki Google zkLogin + Slush wallet; backend verifies signed challenge → Sui address, JWT session
4. **LLM router (D-011)** — replace `HardcodedRouter` with `AnthropicRouter` using `@anthropic-ai/sdk` + structured output + zod schema. Cost ~$0.001/call (Haiku). Keep `Router` interface unchanged so frontend code does not refactor
5. **Lineage on Walrus (D-011)** — backend writes `lineage.json` blob alongside GLB per generation (prompt, LLM decision trace, params, generator source)
6. **End-to-end** — type → LLM route → procedural generate → preview → Walrus upload → PTB `model3d::mint` → testnet wallet shows Model3D NFT
7. **Generator catalog expansion** — add sword / hammer / platform generators (total 6+ shapes)

### Blockers / Open Questions
See `docs/open-questions.md`. None block Phase 2 start. Open follow-ups carried from D-011:
- Anthropic API budget tracking (Haiku ~$0.001/call; demo budget ~$0.10 — not material)
- Phase 3 Tripo decision (catalog adequacy review) — not blocking Phase 2

### Notes for Next Session
- **Phase 1 invariants to preserve in Phase 2**:
  - `Router` interface in `shared/src/types.ts` is the seam — Phase 2's `AnthropicRouter` must implement it; frontend `lib/api.ts` and Hono route handlers should not change
  - `Generator` interface is the second seam — Phase 3's optional `TripoGenerator` slots in here
  - `LineageRecord` is the third seam — Phase 2 fills `prompt` and `llmDecision`, Phase 3 may flip `generatorSource` to `'tripo'`
- Backend GLB store is currently `backend/tmp/<uuid>.glb` (local disk). Phase 2 replaces with Walrus upload — `backend/tmp/` writes can be kept as a transient staging area before Walrus PUT, or dropped entirely if frontend uploads directly via upload relay
- Per D-013: Kiosk + TransferPolicy is v1 must-have (Phase 4), L2 Derivative is v1.1 deferred (preserve `Derivative` / `DerivativeApproval` Move structs in `spec.md §2.8` but do not implement in v1)
- User stated preference: **finish early, more time for pitch deck + demo video polish**. Bias toward compressing Phase 1–4, expanding Phase 5
- All 13 ADRs (D-001 ... D-013) in `docs/decisions.md` — do not reopen without prompting
- Frontend TS pin is `~5.8.0` (matches Vite scaffold's `erasableSyntaxOnly` requirement); backend + shared are on `~5.5.0`. Not unified yet — bump when convenient
- `vite.config.ts` and `vitest.config.ts` are split intentionally — Vitest 2.x's bundled Vite 5 types conflict with Vite 8's `server.proxy`. Don't merge them back without a Vitest 3 upgrade
- **Procedural mesh testing lesson (Phase 1 cylinder bug)**: vertex-count + triangle-count assertions are NOT enough. They pass while winding is inverted — only browser rendering reveals it. **For every new generator added in Phase 2+, write a normal-direction test for at least one representative triangle per face/cap.** See `backend/src/generators/cylinder.test.ts:triNormalY` for the helper pattern; Phase 2 generators (sword, hammer, platform) should each carry equivalents
- v2+ vision (post-hackathon): full Composable Creator Economy / Programmable IP Layer (D-001 vision) once L2 PMF validated
