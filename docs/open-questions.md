## OQ-001: What is MemWal (Walrus Memory) exactly?

**Why this matters**: Sui Overflow 2026 Walrus track framing is "verifiable data **and memory layer**". The "memory layer" part likely refers to MemWal. We may be missing a pitch hook by not integrating it.

**To resolve**: Read MemWal playground + GitHub repo. Compare against current Model3D design — does MemWal fit our use case (data layer for asset metadata?), or is it for agent memory (different scope)?

**Blocker level**: 🟡 Worth investigating before Phase 4 / pitch writing. Not blocking Phase 1.

## OQ-002: Real Walrus mainnet cost for ~100KB GLB, 10 epochs

**Why this matters**: Need real cost numbers before pricing model design (`Model3D.direct_access_price` / `Derivative.derivative_price`) and for pitch slide on "Walrus cheaper than S3+CloudFront".

**To resolve**: Run `walrus info` against mainnet system object after first deploy. Or check current-state cost calculator if accessible.

**Blocker level**: 🟢 Not blocking. Estimate as fractions of a cent for now.

## OQ-003: Enoki sponsored-tx on testnet — truly free?

**Why this matters**: Demo Day killer feature ("user signs in with Google, no gas, mints model"). If testnet sponsored tx counts against the free-tier quota, may need to pay $120/mo Pro plan earlier than planned.

**To resolve**: Register Enoki sandbox account, run one sponsored testnet tx, check dashboard quota.

**Blocker level**: 🟢 Not blocking. Worst case: pay during demo polish — $120 is acceptable.

---

## OQ-004: @mysten/dapp-kit 1.0 actual import paths

**Why this matters**: 1.0 was split into `-core` + `-react`. Most sample apps online are pre-1.0. We may hit cryptic import errors during Phase 2.

**To resolve**: Check current `sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit` starter; try imports in a minimal test app.

**Blocker level**: 🟡 Resolve before Phase 2 dapp-kit integration.

---

## OQ-005: Walrus package ID on testnet AND mainnet (current)

**Why this matters**: Hardcoding wrong package ID → build fails. MVR alias `@walrus/core` is the supposed-to-work path.

**To resolve**: Either resolve dynamically via system object lookup (`sui client object <SYSTEM_OBJECT_ID>`) or commit to MVR alias in `Move.toml` and never hardcode. Sanity-check works on both networks.

**Blocker level**: 🟡 Resolve during Phase 2 Move integration.

---

## OQ-006: DeepSurge submission portal — fields and flow

**Why this matters**: Submission deadline 6/21. If portal has surprise requirements (custom video format, special demo URL pattern, team registration prereqs, ID verification), we want to know now, not 6/20.

**To resolve**: Register on DeepSurge with placeholder team, examine submission form fields and required uploads.

**Blocker level**: 🟢 Not blocking, but worth doing before 6/15 buffer.

---

## OQ-007: Where to acquire mainnet WAL for demo

**Why this matters**: Mainnet has no WAL faucet. Need to plan: exchange (Binance / Coinbase / OKX)? DEX? OTC? Bridging via Wormhole?

**To resolve**: Check `walrus.xyz` for current mainnet WAL acquisition options; budget $5–20 for demo storage + ~$50 buffer.

**Blocker level**: 🟡 Resolve before Phase 4 mainnet deploy.

---

## OQ-008: Forensic watermark approach for 3D meshes

**Why this matters**: Phase 4 stretch C. If we attempt this, need a workable algorithm (mesh micro-perturbation encoding user ID, or texture metadata steganography).

**To resolve**: Research existing 3D watermarking academic literature; pick simplest approach for Phase 4.

**Blocker level**: 🟢 Not blocking; only relevant if attempting stretch C.

---

## OQ-009: Sample game scene tech choice (Three.js vs Unity WebGL)

**Why this matters**: Phase 3 deliverable. Three.js is web-native, lighter, easier to embed in demo. Unity WebGL is more "game dev legitimate" but larger setup overhead (bundle size, build pipeline).

**To resolve**: User preference + time budget. Recommend Three.js for v1 (faster to ship, no build pipeline).

**Blocker level**: 🟡 Resolve before Phase 3 start (5/30).

---

## OQ-010: Pitch deck format and length

**Why this matters**: Sui Overflow handbook didn't specify a pitch deck format for shortlisted teams' Demo Day pitch. Typical hackathon: 5–10 slides, 5 minutes total. Without explicit guidance, default to industry-standard.

**To resolve**: Check handbook + ask devrel@sui.io if shortlisted teams get specific deck requirements.

**Blocker level**: 🟢 Not blocking; relevant if shortlisted (announced 7/8).
